            Climate change is a global challenge and fighting it requires
            coordinated actions by all countries in the world. Bioenergy is a
            key strategy to reduce carbon emissions and limit dependence on
            fossil fuels.

            Since Vietnam has the advantage in large sustainably planted forest
            areas, it is a potential country to develop strong logging and
